I am currently a faculty member in Artificial Intelligence at Duke University, an AI/ML research scientist, and a startup advisor.

As a leader in bridging the gap between research and industry in machine learning, I have led projects and developed algorithms for the largest companies in the world. More importantly, I have built algorithms that have meaningful impacts - from helping people walk to noninvasively monitoring glucose.

My current research interests are broadly centered in XAI (Explainable AI), Adversarial AI, and AI in digital health. I like to explore ideas at the intersection of ethics, human-AI interaction, and computational concepts. Lots of work in progress :)
