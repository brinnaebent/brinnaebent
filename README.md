# Brinnae Bent | [@RunsData](https://runsdata.org)



I am a digital health data scientist and I recently defended my PhD on discovering digital biomarkers of glycemic health from wearable sensors. I am an incoming data scientist at [Edge Analytics](https://edgeanalytics.io)

I am currently the lead software developer at the [Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP)](https://dbdp.org/), an open source software platform for developing digital biomarkers from mHealth and wearables data. 

I make open source code for digital medicine, like my Python packages that enable data analysis and feature engineering of wearable sensors: [cgmquantify](https://github.com/brinnaebent/cgmquantify) and [wearablevar](https://github.com/brinnaebent/wearablevar). I also [blog](https://medium.com/@RunsData) about tools for data science and machine learning.
