I am currently a faculty member in Artificial Intelligence at Duke University, an AI/ML research scientist, and a startup advisor.

As a leader in bridging the gap between research and industry in machine learning, I have led projects and developed algorithms for the largest companies in the world. More importantly, I have built algorithms that have meaningful impacts - from helping people walk to noninvasively monitoring glucose.

My current research interests are in XAI (Explainable AI) and AI in digital health.
