I am currently an adjunct faculty member in Artificial Intelligence at Duke University and an AI/ML researcher.

As a leader in bridging the gap between research and industry in machine learning, I have led projects and developed algorithms for the largest companies in the world. More importantly, I have built algorithms that have meaningful impacts - from helping people walk to noninvasively monitoring glucose.

I am passionate about open source software, having founded the [Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP)](https://dbdp.org) during my PhD.
