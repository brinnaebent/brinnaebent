I am a data scientist training machines to learn digital biomarkers from sensors. I am finishing my thesis on developing digital biomarkers of prediabetes in the Big Ideas Lab at Duke University.

I am currently the lead software developer at the [Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP)](DBDP.org), an open source software platform for developing digital biomarkers from mHealth and wearables data.
